1. Video Upload
  - Encrypted (Tooltip with a link details for DRM pricing)
  - Non Encrypted

  #Encrypted:
    - If a user choose to upload video encrypted way, then the video should be saved in vdocipher

  #Non Encrypted:
    - If a user choose to upload video non encrypted way, then the video should be saved in aws s3 bucket.


2. Video Preview for both instructor and super admin:
  #Encrypted:
    - If the video is encrypted, then use vdo cipher api and preview with their embedded player.

  P.S: 
  If the video is encrypted, when an instructor or super admin will want to preview the video, the bandwidth will count.
  We need to optimize this.
  
  #Non Encrypted:
    - If the video is not encrypted, then use video js player to preview the video.

3. Video delete option for super admin:
  - If any instructor wants to remove video, s/he needs to inform super admin. Then super admin can delete the video.

4. SSL Commerz payment:
  - Add instructor info in the invoice in SSL Commerz payment.
